- **[Express.js Rebuilt Its Vulnerability Reporting Process](https://expressjs.com/2025/06/05/vulnerability-reporting-process-overhaul.html)** - The Express.js project has updated its vulnerability reporting process to better handle issues in the growing complexity of the framework. Key improvements include a formalized workflow for reporting security vulnerabilities, a unified SECURITY policy across repositories, and adoption of GitHub Security Advisories for better coordination. This overhaul aims to enhance response transparency and speed while also laying the groundwork for a future Bug Bounty Program, significantly benefiting the Node.js community by improving the security of this widely used framework.

- **[Bun v1.2.15 Release](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.2.15)** - The latest release of Bun (v1.2.15) introduces critical features including `bun audit` for scanning dependencies for security vulnerabilities, which is similar to `npm audit` but designed for Bun's ecosystem. Additionally, compatibility improvements with Node.js modules such as `vm.SourceTextModule` are highlighted, enabling better ECMAScript module handling within different contexts. The effort to enhance security within Bun's framework demonstrates its commitment to keeping up with emerging risks, making it significant for developers focusing on Node.js and related technologies.
